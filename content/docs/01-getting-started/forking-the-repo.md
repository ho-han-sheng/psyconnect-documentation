## What is Forking?

From the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#about-forks):

> A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.

Essentially, a fork is your copy of the entire repository. This allows multiple people to develop independently and simultaneously as everyone has their own copy. With this, you can experiment with and make edits to your own copy without affecting our "live" webpage and the main codebase.

The belowmentioned steps will guide you in forking our website's repository to your GitHub account.

> ❗ You should have created and logged in to your GitHub account at this stage.

## Steps to Fork the Website Repository

1. Navigate to our website's repository and click on the `Fork` button in the top right.

2. Click on the green `Create fork` button on this window.

3. You should now see your forked copy of the repository at `your-username/PsyConnect.github.io` forked from `PsyConnect/PsyConnect.github.io`.

Congratulations! You now have your own online copy of the repository. But what if you (1) want to edit your code offline, (2) don't have an internet connection or (3) want to make multiple changes to different files?

## Cloning the Fork to Local Computer

GitHub's online code editor while useful has its limitations, therefore we need to obtain an offline copy of the repository for us to work on it with our installed code editors. However, this is not just a simple downloading of all files, we also want our local copy on our computers to be synchronised with our fork on GitHub. We can achieve this with cloning!

Feel free to refer to the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) for more information on cloning.

## Steps to Clone the Fork

1. Open up GitHub Desktop and log in to your account. You may wish to refer to `2:48` in the [first video we mentioned](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE?t=168) to guide you through set up.
2. Go to `File` and click `Clone repository`.

3. Choose the forked repository `your-username/PsyConnect.github.io` and choose where you wish to save it in your computer under `Local path`.
