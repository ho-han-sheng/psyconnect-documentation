Essentially, Git is a version control software (VCS) and GitHub is a website that allows us to host our code online.

## Github Account

This account is required for you to collaborate and interact with our codebase. As all profiles and commits are **public**, we highly suggest choosing a professional handle and one that allows reviewers to clearly identify you.

You may also refer to [GitHub's exisiting guides and documentation](https://docs.github.com/en).
