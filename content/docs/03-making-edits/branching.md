You may wish to refer to `17:02` in the [first video we mentioned](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE?t=1022) for a quick overview on what branching is. 

> ‚ùó Always create a new branch before making any new changes locally, do not commit directly to `main`. This is a best practice throughout software development.

Here are the steps to creating a branch in GitHub Desktop:

1. On GitHub Desktop, go to `Branch` and click `New branch`.

2. Create a name for your new branch. Try to keep them descriptive and relevant to the edits you would be making.

3. Your current branch should now reflect your chosen name for the new branch.
